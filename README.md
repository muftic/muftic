### My Last Projects:

#### PictionAI

For my Codaisseur portfolio full-stack project I built an online game where the player uploads his drawing of a given task, and the "PicionAI" gives you a score based on the classifications of the drawing. The more confident PictionAI is, the higher score you get. The front-end is created with JavaScript, React, Redux and CSS, and the back-end with an Express server, JWT & Bcrypt authentication and a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM. The classification of the drawing comes from ml5 with MobileNet's pre-trained model.

#### TinPet

Group project, using JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS with Bootstrap, Chat Engine + Firebase.
Team of three in 5 days - built a tinder-like application but for pets, so users can meet new friends (or more!) for their pets.
The back-end was built using Node.js, Express , PostgreSQL, Sequelize.
