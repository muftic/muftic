### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marijan, and in 2020 I decided to make a career in speaking with machines.
First, I took a year to study JavaScript, then I moved from Volosko, Croatia to Amsterdam, Netherlands and enrolled in [Codaisseur's](https://codaisseur.com/) Full-Stack JavaScript Academy which gave me a _massive_ boost to both knowledge and experience in programming and web-development.

### Tech stack experience:

  <p>
  Javascript</br> Node.js</br> React</br>Redux</br>Express</br>Sequelize</br>PostgreSQL</br>Html</br>Css</br>
 
  
 and currently I'm learning:
  <p>
  Machine learning - for now I've used <a href="https://ml5js.org/">ml5<a> for image classification(Mobile net's model), and am interested in training my own model.
  </p><p>
 <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript<a>
  </p> <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native<a>
  </p>

### My Last Projects:

#### PictionAI

For my Codaisseur portfolio full-stack project I built an online game where the player uploads his drawing of a given task, and the "PicionAI" gives you a score based on the classifications of the drawing. The more confident PictionAI is, the higher score you get. The front-end is created with JavaScript, React, Redux and CSS, and the back-end with an Express server, JWT & Bcrypt authentication and a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM. The classification of the drawing comes from ml5 with MobileNet's pre-trained model.

#### TinPet

Group project, using JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS with Bootstrap, Chat Engine + Firebase.
Team of three in 5 days - built a tinder-like application but for pets, so users can meet new friends (or more!) for their pets.
The back-end was built using Node.js, Express , PostgreSQL, Sequelize.
